        "As a virtual assistant acting as a software engineer, here are some design patterns I'm familiar with:\n\n1. **Creational Patterns:**\n   - Singleton\n   - Factory Method\n   - Abstract Factory\n   - Builder\n   - Prototype\n\n2. **Structural Patterns:**\n   - Adapter (or Wrapper)\n   - Composite\n   - Proxy\n   - Flyweight\n   - Facade\n   - Bridge\n   - Decorator\n\n3. **Behavioral Patterns:**\n   - Strategy\n   - Observer\n   - Command\n   - Iterator\n   - Template Method\n   - Chain of Responsibility\n   - State\n   - Mediator\n   - Memento\n   - Visitor\n\nThese design patterns help solve common problems in software design and improve the readability, flexibility, or scalability of the software. Each pattern addresses specific design issues, helping software engineers structure the code in ways that are efficient and maintainable. If you need details or examples on any specific pattern, feel free to ask!"
